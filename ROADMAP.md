# Productivity Hub Roadmap

This roadmap is a step-by-step checklist for building your productivity assistant. Each version milestone is a focused, bite-sized release leading up to v1.0. Celebrate every step! Check off each task as you complete it!

---

## Versioning Guide
- **Format:** vX.Y.Z (e.g., v0.1.0, v0.2.0, v0.10.0, v0.11.0)
  - **Major (X):** Big changes or breaking changes
  - **Minor (Y):** Small, focused, and rewarding feature sets (increments by 1 for each new version, goes to double digits as needed)
  - **Patch (Z):** Bug fixes or tiny tweaks (can go to double digits as needed)
- **Pre-1.0:** Use v0.Y.0 for alpha/beta releases. Each version is a personal milestoneâ€”make them as small and rewarding as you like!
