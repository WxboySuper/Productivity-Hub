# Productivity Hub Roadmap

This roadmap is a step-by-step checklist for building your productivity assistant. Each version milestone is a focused, bite-sized release leading up to v1.0. Celebrate every step! Check off each task as you complete it!

---

## Versioning Guide

- **Format:** vX.Y.Z (e.g., v0.1.0, v0.2.0, v0.10.0, v0.11.0)
  - **Major (X):** Big changes or breaking changes
  - **Minor (Y):** Small, focused, and rewarding feature sets (increments by 1 for each new version, goes to double digits as needed)
  - **Patch (Z):** Bug fixes or tiny tweaks (can go to double digits as needed)
- **Pre-1.0:** Use v0.Y.0 for alpha/beta releases. Each version is a personal milestone‚Äîmake them as small and rewarding as you like!
- **API Change Summary Requirement:** For every stable, alpha, or beta release, summarize all API changes (new endpoints, deleted endpoints, changes to endpoints, etc.) in the changelog, even if they were already documented in dev releases. This ensures the release notes provide a complete overview of API evolution for each version.
